		"Every RevOps manager knows the pain: 20+ hours weekly troubleshooting misrouted leads, stitching together Zapier chains that break at the worst moments, and explaining to sales why hot prospects disappeared into workflow black holes. We started Default because we lived this reality and knew there had to be a better way.",
		"Instead of building another point solution, we reimagined revenue operations from the ground up. Default transforms fragmented go-to-market chaos into unified visual workflows that actually workâ€”combining scheduling, routing, enrichment, and CRM automation in one platform that your entire team can manage without engineering help.",
		"Today, hundreds of fast-growing companies trust Default to power their inbound operations. From Bland AI routing 10,000 leads in six months to OpenPhone cutting speed-to-lead by 67%, we're proving that revenue operations doesn't have to be held together with digital duct tape. The future of RevOps is unified, visual, and built for the teams who live it every day."
